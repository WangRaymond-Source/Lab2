                <p><h2>Today is a very sunny day and birds chirping really loud early in the morning. 
                I woke up today and did my morning jog as usually as I needed to get out of the house and 
                be active throughout this the Covid situtaion. I would be really happy to be back on my college campus (UCSD).
                UCSD is a buetiful campus as it is located in La Jolla california, right next to a beach. Today's weather really
                reminded me of campus as it was always sunny and warm. Here in my home town weather varies as we experience all four seasons.
                After my jog, i came back and relaxed a litle bit and then caught up on some lectures from my classes that are not asynchronous.
                After hours of lectures I decided take a break and play basketball with my friends and we ran five on five game at my old high school. 
                Coming back from playing basketball I had to catch up on some homework and projects from my classes. Then I ended my end off watching some youTube Videos.
                Today has been a regular day.
