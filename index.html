                    <p>Today is a very sunny day and birds <i>chirping</i> really loud early in the morning. 
                    I woke up today and did my morning jog as usually as I needed to get out of the house and 
                    be active throughout this the Covid situtaion. I would be really happy to be back on my college campus <b>(UCSD)</b>.
                    <b>UCSD</b> is a buetiful campus as it is located in La Jolla california, right next to a beach. Today's weather really
                    reminded me of campus as it was always sunny and warm. Here in my home town weather varies as we experience all four seasons.
                    After my jog, i came back and relaxed a litle bit and then caught up on some lectures from my classes that are not asynchronous.
                    After hours of lectures I decided take a break and play basketball with my friends and we ran five on five game at my old high school. 
                    Coming back from playing basketball I had to catch up on some homework and projects from my classes. Then I ended my end off watching some youTube Videos.
                    <br>Today has been a regular day.<br>
                    </p>
